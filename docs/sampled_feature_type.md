[]{#SampledFeatureTypevocabulary}

# **Concept scheme:** Sampled Feature Type vocabulary

Vocabulary last modified:  2024-04-19

subtitle: 
  Categories to specify the broad context that a sample is intended to represent.

Namespace: 
[`https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/sampledfeature/1.0/sampledfeaturevocabulary`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/sampledfeature/1.0/sampledfeaturevocabulary)

**History**

* 2021-07-09  Remove Marine biome, Subaerial terrestrial environment, Subaqueous terrestrial environment per github issue https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/issues/41. Make Experiment setting and Laboratory or curatorial environment subclasses of Active human occupation site.
* 2021-12-10 SMR add missing skos:inScheme statements
* 2022-01-07 SMR change to https://w3id.org/isample/ uri base, make the ConceptScheme an ontology as well. For uploading to ESIP COR and w3id resolution redirect set up. Add some mappings to other ontologies using seeAlso, closeMatch, narrowMatch.
* 2022-03-11 SMR change definitions from rdfs:comment to skos:definition. Minor fixes in definitions. Add skos matches to URIs from other vocabularies. Fix typo in glacierenvrionment URI (changed the URI to glacierenvironment)
* 2022-09-07 SMR update some of the skos mappings to other vocabularies; remove references to other vocabularies as NamedIndividual. Remove rocksample class, it was not linked in hierarchy and inconsistent with design.
* 2022-09-30 add biological entity as sampled feature, per issue https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/issues/107. This update was lost at some point and added back in 2022-12-09.
* 2023-11-05 SMR update version to 1.0, prep for release
* 2024-04-19 SMR update definitions to remove use of 'specimen'. Edit some definitions for better clarity

**Concepts**

[]{#anysampledfeature}

##  Any sampled feature


- Any thing that can be sampled. Top concept in sampled feature type
vocabulary.
- Concept URI token: anysampledfeature


[]{#anthropogenicenvironment}

###  Anthropogenic environment


- Child of:
 [`anysampledfeature`](#anysampledfeature)

- Sampled feature is produced by or related to human activity past or
present.

[]{#activehumanoccupationsite}

####  Active human occupation site


- Child of:
 [`anthropogenicenvironment`](#anthropogenicenvironment)

- sampled feature is a site at which there are ongoing human
activities
- Concept URI token: activehumanoccupationsite


[]{#experimentsetting}

#####  Experiment setting


- Child of:
 [`activehumanoccupationsite`](#activehumanoccupationsite)

- Sampled feature is an experimental set up that produced the sample;
the sample is the product of the experiment.
- Concept URI token: experimentsetting


[]{#laboratorycuratorialenvironment}

#####  Laboratory or curatorial environment


- Child of:
 [`activehumanoccupationsite`](#activehumanoccupationsite)

- Sampled feature is a laboratory or other research site, collected
with intention of characterizing the environment in which data are
collected or other research conducted, that might affect results or
safety; e.g. lab blank measurements.
- Concept URI token: laboratorycuratorialenvironment


[]{#pasthumanoccupationsite}

####  Site of past human activities


- Child of:
 [`anthropogenicenvironment`](#anthropogenicenvironment)

- sampled feature is a place where humans have been and left evidence
of their activity. Includes prehistoric and paleo hominid sites
- Concept URI token: pasthumanoccupationsite


[]{#biologicalentity}

###  Biological entity


- Child of:
 [`anysampledfeature`](#anysampledfeature)

- Sampled feature is an organism. Use for samples that represent some
species of organism as the proximate sampled feature, not the
environment that the organism inhabits.
- Concept URI token: biologicalentity


[]{#earthenvironment}

###  Earth environment


- Child of:
 [`anysampledfeature`](#anysampledfeature)
