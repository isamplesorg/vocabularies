# src directory

This directory used to contain the source rdf/turtle files for iSamples vocabularies. The vocabulary managment has been refactored, so that the iSamples core vocabularies (material type, material sample type, sampled feature type) are now in the [vocabulary directory](https://github.com/isamplesorg/vocabularies/tree/main/vocabulary) in this repository.  Extension vocabularies are in separate repositories specific to a domain/community, currently [Earth and Environmental Science]([https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata_profile_earth_science](https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata_profile_earth_science/tree/main/vocabulary)https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata_profile_earth_science/tree/main/vocabulary), [Biology](https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata_profile_biology), and [Archaeology](https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata_profile_archaeology/tree/main/vocabulary)
