  skos:editorNote "There has been considerable discussion of use of 'specimen' vs. 'sample'; the two terms are considered essentially synonyms in the iSamples context. 'Specimen' was used originally, but after discussion with reviewers, we decided to switch to 'material sample', consistent with Darwin Core TDWG wg decision (https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_MaterialSample) and current OGC O&M/ISO19156 (http://www.opengis.net/doc/as/om/3.0).

Intention is a specimen category for solid objects that are not biologic; this subsumes 'Fossil' and 'Artifact', but excludes living organism, their parts and products. Obviously there is some overlap with Research specimens."@en ;

  skos:note "The material sample object type is intended to be orthogonal to material type and sampled feature, but there are dependencies between some categories.  The material sample object type is mostly determined by the nature of the sample object (solid, fluid, aggregate...), what kind of containment is necessary, and by the genetic origin of the material or object. There is overlap between some of the classes-- Research products might be solid objects or aggregations. Whole organisms, Fossils and Artifacts are typically solid objects. Multiple categories can be assigned to a sample, or one aspect can be chosen as pre-eminent."@en ;
